# Node.js - Demo Web Application

This is a simple Node.js web app using the Express framework and EJS templates.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

The app has several basic pages accessed from the top navigation menu, some of which are only lit up when certain configuration variables are set (see 'Optional Features' below):

- **'Info'** - Will show system & runtime information, and will also display if the app is running from within a Docker container and Kubernetes.
- **'Tools'** - Some tools useful in demos, such a forcing CPU load (for autoscale demos), and error/exception pages for use with App Insights or other monitoring tool.
- **'Monitor'** - Display realtime monitoring data, showing memory usage/total and process CPU load.
- **'Weather'** - (Optional) Gets the location of the client page (with HTML5 Geolocation). The resulting location is used to fetch a weather forecast from the [Dark Sky](http://darksky.net) weather API
- **'Todo'** - (Optional) This is a small todo/task-list app which uses MongoDB as a database.
- **'User Account'** - (Optional) When configured with Azure AD (application client id and secret) user login button will be enabled, and an user-account details page enabled, which calls the Microsoft Graph API

Web app will be listening on the usual Express port of 3000, but this can be changed by setting the `PORT` environmental variable. Tested with Node v8.x, 10.x, 12.x and 14.x

# Containers

Public container image is [available on GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/users/benc-uk/packages/container/package/nodejs-demoapp).

Run in a container with:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/benc-uk/nodejs-demoapp:latest
```

Should you want to build your own container, use `make image` and the above variables to customise the name & tag.

## Kubernetes

The app can easily be deployed to Kubernetes using Helm, see [deploy/kubernetes/readme.md](deploy/kubernetes/readme.md) for details

# GitHub Actions CI/CD

A working set of CI and CD release GitHub Actions workflows are provided `.github/workflows/`, automated builds are run in GitHub hosted runners

# Optional Features

The app will start up and run with zero configuration, however the only features that will be available will be the INFO and TOOLS views. The following optional features can be enabled:

### Application Insights

Enable this by setting `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`

The app has been instrumented with the Application Insights SDK, it will however need to be configured to point to your App Insights instance/workspace. All requests will be tracked, as well as dependant calls to MongoDB or other APIs (if configured), exceptions & error will also be logged

[This article](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/app-insights-nodejs) has more information on monitoring Node.js with App Insights

### Weather Details

Enable this by setting `WEATHER_API_KEY`

This will require a API key from Dark Sky, you can [sign up for free and get one here](https://darksky.net/dev). The page uses a browser API for geolocation to fetch the user's location.  
However, the `geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` browser API will only work when the site is served via HTTPS or from localhost. As a fallback, weather for London, UK will be show if the current position can not be obtained

### User Authentication with Azure AD

Enable this by setting `AAD_APP_ID`, `AAD_APP_SECRET`

This uses [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Node](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/tree/dev/lib/msal-node) to authenticate via MSAL with OIDC and OAuth 2.0. The flow it uses is the "OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant", which is standard for server side (confidential) apps.

In addition the user account page shows details & photo retrieved from the Microsoft Graph API

You will need to register an app in your Azure AD tenant. [See this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app). Add a secret to your app and use the app's ID & secret value in `AAD_APP_ID` & `AAD_APP_SECRET`

`AAD_REDIRECT_URL_BASE` should be the base URL of where your app is running, e.g. `http://localhost:3000` or `https://example.com`. It should start with `http://` or `https://`. This is used by the login flow to redirect back to the app, the path `/redirect` will be appended to this value to form the complete redirect URL

### Todo App

Enable this by setting `TODO_MONGO_CONNSTR`

A mini todo & task tracking app can be enabled if a MongoDB backend is provided and a connection string to access it. This feature is primarily to show database dependency detection and tracking in App Insights

The default database name is `todoDb` but you can change this by setting `TODO_MONGO_DB`

You can stand up MongoDB in a container instance or in Cosmos DB (using the Mongo API). Note. When using Cosmos DB and the _per database provisioned RU/s_ option, you must manually create the collection called `todos` in the relevant database and set the shard key to `_id`

# Configuration

The following configuration environmental variables are supported, however none are mandatory. These can be set directly or when running locally will be picked up from an `.env` file if it is present. A sample `.env` file called `.env.sample` is provided for you to copy

If running in an Azure Web App, all of these values can be injected as application settings in Azure.

| Environmental Variable         | Default | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PORT                           | 3000    | Port the server will listen on                                                                   |
| TODO_MONGO_CONNSTR             | _none_  | Connect to specified MongoDB instance, when set the Todo feature will be enabled in the menu bar |
| TODO_MONGO_DB                  | todoDb  | Name of the database in MongoDB to use (optional)                                                |
| APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY | _none_  | Enable Application Insights monitoring                                                           |
| WEATHER_API_KEY                | _none_  | DarkSky weather API key. [Info here](https://darksky.net/dev)                                    |
| AAD_APP_ID                     | _none_  | Application ID of app registered in Azure AD                                                     |
| AAD_APP_SECRET                 | _none_  | Secret / password of app registered in Azure AD                                                  |
| AAD_REDIRECT_URL_BASE          | _none_  | Hostname/domain where app is running                                                             |

## Running in Azure App Service (Linux)

If you want to deploy to an Azure Web App as a container (aka Linux Web App), a Bicep template is provided in the [deploy](deploy/) directory

For a super quick deployment, use `make deploy` which will deploy to a resource group, temp-demoapps and use the git ref to create a unique site name

```bash
make deploy
```

You can also very quickly deploy to Azure App Service directly with the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) and `az webapp up`. Note. `<app-name>` must be globally unique. Change the sku to a larger size, e.g. `P1V2` for a much faster deployment

```
cd src
az webapp up --sku F1 --name <app-name>
```
